- Polygenic risk scores (PRS) attempt to integrate complex associations between many genetic factors in phenotypes of interest.
- PRS's have adequate resolution to inform disease prevention, early diagnosis, and actionable therapeutic and lifestyle choices. They are versatile in application to many phenotypes of interest.
- The heritability of a phenotype is the proportion of phenotypic variation that genotypic variation explains. This definition of heritability applies to the population level and is different than the extent of risk from an individual's cumulative genetic variants. For example, the heritability of breast cancer (a heterogeneous disease) is low in the population, but BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations impart a very high risk for a specific type of breast cancer to individuals.
- It is likely only in rare cases that a phenotype would have very low heritability but would still have a high risk genetic variant.
- Polygenic risk scores are likely to have greater uncertainty than risk prediction for familial, simpler genetic disease. How do we quantify this uncertainty?
- Polygenic risk scores are less definitive than simple (single gene) genetic disease risks.
- Polygenic risk scores are specific to the training population and are more susceptible to bias from data sets that lack appropriate diversity.
