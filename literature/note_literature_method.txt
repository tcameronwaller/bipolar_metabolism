- stratified LD score regression from Finucane and ___, Nature Genetics, 2015 partitions heritability between binary, nominal genomic annotations: sets of genomic SNVs with functional relevance, such as epigenomic architecture
- authors extended stratified LD score regression for ratio-scale continuous genomic annotations: recombination rate, linkage disequilibrium, allele age, allele frequency
- authors observed that "common variants that are more recent tend to have lower LLD and to explain more heritability, which is consistent with the action of negative selection, as selection has had less time to eliminate recent weakly deleterious variants"
- greater SNV-specific heritability correlates with: more common variant frequency, more recent or newer alleles, and lesser linkage disequilibrium

Title: "The personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk scores"

- Polygenic risk scores (PRS) attempt to integrate complex associations between many genetic factors in phenotypes of interest.
- PRS's have adequate resolution to inform disease prevention, early diagnosis, and actionable therapeutic and lifestyle choices. They are versatile in application to many phenotypes of interest.
- The heritability of a phenotype is the proportion of phenotypic variation that genotypic variation explains. This definition of heritability applies to the population level and is different than the extent of risk from an individual's cumulative genetic variants. For example, the heritability of breast cancer (a heterogeneous disease) is low in the population, but BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations impart a very high risk for a specific type of breast cancer to individuals.
- It is likely only in rare cases that a phenotype would have very low heritability but would still have a high risk genetic variant.
- Polygenic risk scores are likely to have greater uncertainty than risk prediction for familial, simpler genetic disease. How do we quantify this uncertainty?
- Polygenic risk scores are less definitive than simple (single gene) genetic disease risks.
- Polygenic risk scores are specific to the training population and are more susceptible to bias from data sets that lack appropriate diversity.
